    "## Notation\n",

    "$x$ is a scalar quantity, measured $N$ times\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_i$ is a single measurement with $i=1,...,N$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\{x_i\\}$ refers to the set of all N measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "We are generally trying to *estimate* $h(x)$, the *true* distribution from which the values of $x$ are drawn. We will refer to $h(x)$ as the probability density (distribution) function or the \"pdf\" and $h(x)dx$ is the propobability of a value lying between $x$ and $x+dx$. \n",
    "\n",
    "While $h(x)$ is the \"true\" pdf (or **population** pdf).  What we *measure* from the data is the **empirical** pdf, which is denoted $f(x)$.  So, $f(x)$ is a *model* of $h(x)$.  In principle, with infinite data $f(x) \\rightarrow h(x)$, but in reality measurement errors keep this from being strictly true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are attempting to guess a *model* for $h(x)$, then the process is *parametric*.  With a model solution we can generate new data that should mimic what we measure.  If we are not attempting to guess a model, then the process is *nonparametic*.  That is we are just trying to describe the data that we see in the most compact manner that we can, but we are not trying to produce mock data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histograms that we made last time are an example of a nonparametric method of describing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could summarize the goal of this class an attempt to 1) estimate $f(x)$ from some real (possibly multi-dimensional) data set, 2) find a way to describe $f(x)$ and its uncertainty, 3) compare it to models of $h(x)$, and then 4) use the knowledge that we have gained in order to interpret new measurements."
