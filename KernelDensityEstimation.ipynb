    "Inferring the pdf of a sample of data is known as *density estimation*.  Essentially we are smoothing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density estimation is useful because identifying low probability regions can help uncover rare sources.  Similarly, if the data can be divided into subsamples, one can estimate the pdf for each subsample and, in turn, determine classifications for new objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Nonparametric* density estimation is useful when we know nothing about the underlying distribution of the data since we don't have to specify a model.  This flexibility allows us to capture the shape of the distribution well, at the expense of more difficulty interpreting the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "[*Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) is the standard here (and, incidentally, is something that we have been doing in my group for about 15 years now).\n",
